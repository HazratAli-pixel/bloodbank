<h1>Why should I donate blood?</h1>
<b>Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:</b>


<p> Women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;</p>

<p>Children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;</p>
<p>People with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; and</p>
<p>Many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.</p>

<p>It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.
</p>
<p>There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.
</p>
<p>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.
